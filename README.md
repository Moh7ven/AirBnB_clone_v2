"<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>" 
" This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions. 'This' n'est pas reconnu en tant que commande interne ou externe, un programme ex‚cutable ou un fichier de commandes."
